# Cleaning Functions
Client agnostic functions designed to standardise social media performance data receieved from Tracer.

For example, functions here can be used to clean column names, clean common columns found in the dataset such
as Country the advert was placed in or the media type of the advert.

For example some of the adverts have "France" as the country, or "francais". These will get converted to FR.
